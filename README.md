This Log-manager program is my second portfolio project that I have completed during my Software Engineering Bootcamp with HyperionDev
This is my first project where I have attempted to use functions in my coding, as well as using multiple .txt files.

-The program is used a tool for the user to search for and view details of specific shipping logs, from different branches of the company.
- You can view the logs by branch, as well as search specifically

- I will be adding OOP to this program in the near future.
